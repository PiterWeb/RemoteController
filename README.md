## How it works 👷‍♂️

This desktop APP is based on the WebRTC 🎞 standard and it uses the power of Go to communicate 🗣 with the Gamepad emulation libraries.
In Windows uses the ViGEm Bus Driver with the ViGEm Client DLL

For the low level actions uses Go.
On the other hand the UI works with Web technologies (WASM, Sveltekit, Tailwind, DaisyUI & Typescript)
